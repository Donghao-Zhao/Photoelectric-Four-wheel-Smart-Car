Design and Making of Photoelectric Four-wheel Smart Car, Electromagnetic Energy-saving Smart Car and Electromagnetic Upright Smart Car

Project Description:

Duration: May 2016 – Aug 2018

Purpose:

To design and make, based on standardized car models and unified MCUs, several electric-powered model cars that can independently identify race course and control themselves to participate in nationwide racing.

Workload:

1. Management: Selected people to build a team and led team members to set up laboratories, including applying for expenditure and room, arranging the layout of the lab, purchasing equipment and applying for reimbursement, laying the race track, installing facilities, teaching new members about knowledge and professional skills, collaborating with other universities’ smart car teams.

2. Hardware: Designed the schematic diagram and PCB of the main control circuit board, operational amplifiers circuit board and motor driver circuit board, printed the PCB and soldered the electronic component onto the PCB, tested the circuit boards.

3. Software: Developed the control system of the model cars running on MCU, including transplanting drivers of photoelectric camera and sensors, filtering data using the Balance Filter algorithm, calculated the deviation between current position and the expectancy, controlled motor and servo to compensate the deviation and the attitude of model car based on the PID algorithm.

Results:

1. A laboratory and a student team were established, three model cars were made, many instruments and facilities were equipped, rules and regulations of the lab were formed.
2. Won the Third Prize in the Shandong Division Electromagnetic Upright Group, in the 13th National University Student Smart Car Competition.
